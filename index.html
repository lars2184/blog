      <h2>Advanced Front End Development: First Week</h2>
      <p>I’m taking a Front End Development course through Portland Code School and the first week is in the books. Overall, it was a good week although I have some catching up to do because I jumped straight into the advanced class! I need to brush off my GitHub skills, get up to speed with <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="blank">Treehouse</a> and figure out what the heck <a href="https://slack.com/" target="blank">Slack</a> is.</p>
      <p>In the first class, we were introduced to pair programming, which is something I’ve never done. As an introduction, we played a game called <a href="http://www.123freecell.com/" target="blank">Free Cell</a>  in pairs. We were then given an assignment to create a web site for a fictional company called the Animal Adoption Agency. <a href="http://stephanieargy.github.io/journal/" target="blank">Stephanie</a> and I paired up over Skype to work on the project and it worked well sharing windows so we could work on the same code. We were able to store the list of kittens in a JSON object and use the list to display them.</p>
      <p>In the second class, we got a review of jQuery. It’s been awhile since I’ve used jQuery, so it was good to go over some key methods. We also had a good overview of the following tabs in the Chrome Developer Tools console:</p>
      <h3>Network</h3>
      <p>I never knew how to make this tab work, but the trick is to click the ‘Disable cache’ box and then refresh the page. All of the page assets are then shown along with load times. A blue line shows when the page is loaded and a red line shows when it is ready, which corresponds to the ready jQuery event.</p>
      <h3>Sources</h3>
      <p>This is where you can debug files. Once you type command + p to select a file, you can set breakpoints in the code where the code execution should stop. Once stopped, you can inspect the objects and variables to debug the code. To advance the code, click the ‘step over’ button or click play to resume. If there’s an object or variable you’d like to keep an eye on you can enter it in the ‘Watch Expressions’ panel.</p>

      <h2>Second Week: Local Storage and Command Line Tools</h2>
      <p>In the second week we learned about local storage and were introduced to command line tools that help automate and manage development.</p>
      <p>Local storage stores data in key/value pairs in the clients browser. I put local storage to use with this blogs glossary and added a form so more words can be added. It got a little tricky since I have a few words of the glossary on the home page. I was able to set up the code so that the ‘displayGlossary’ method takes the html element where the list should be displayed and the number of items to display from the glossary. This way, all of the code is the same except for the call to displayGlossary on the home and glossary page.</p>
      <p>For the command line tools, we followed a <a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/the-command-line-for-web-design-introduction--cms-23493" target="blank">tutorial</a> that helped set up a package manager called npm. We also learned about a CSS preprocessor called SASS and I used it to set up variables for all of the colors being used on my blog. It was then easy to switch out the palette and try different colors. I ended up finding a color palette on the <a href="https://color.adobe.com" target="blank">Adobe Kuler</a> site that I stuck with. </p>
      <p>I'm looking forward to completing the command line tutorial and learning more about different tools that help speed up development. </p>

      <h2>Third Week: Scaffolding, AJAX and Testing</h2>
      <p>During the third week, we were introduced to the project scaffolding tool Yeoman, learned about AJAX and did testing with the Selenium IDE.</p>
      <p>Yeoman and I don’t get along. I had trouble getting Yeoman to run because of EACCESS command line errors. Al helped me install it on my laptop by installing nvm to manage which Node version is being used. I tried doing the same on my home computer, but ran into problems, so currently I only have Yeoman on my laptop. Although it was good to learn about Yeoman, I would have preferred to set up all of the node_modules and task runners manually instead of diving straight into a scaffolding framework. I ended up working through the command line tutorial and setting up my blog to use npm and grunt. It gave me a better idea of everything going on and now Yeoman makes a little more sense, if only I could get it working on my desktop at home!</p>
      <p>It was good to learn about AJAX, something I’ve been meaning to brush up on for awhile. I ended up loading in a JSON file on my blog using AJAX. It was easy to test the AJAX call using the locahost connection that the Browser Sync package sets up.</p>
      <p>We also learned about different types of programmatic testing. Different types of programmatic testing are unit, integration, acceptance, load, platform, and regression. We download a Firefox IDE called Selenium to practice acceptance testing on our adoption site. The Selenium IDE can be a little finicky, but once you work with it for a bit it becomes easier. I was trying to use it for the adoption site on my laptop, but it was hard on the small screen. Since I don’t have Yeoman installed, I couldn’t use my desktop to test the adoption site, so I ran some tests on my blog. The Selenium IDE seemed easier to work with on my desktop, but it might just be that I was use to using the IDE by then.  </p>

      <h2>Fourth Week: BaaS and Style Guides</h2>
      <p>The fourth week turned into two weeks thanks to Memorial Day and the class being extended, which gave us more time to finish up our projects and learn about BaaS and Style guides.</p>
      <p>We learned about BaaS (Backend as a service) by using Apigee to store data. I didn’t have any experience using a service like Apigee so it was a great exercise to use it for our pet adoption site and this blog. I ended up getting it to work for the glossary of this blog storing the whole glossary as one big JSON object. If I have time, I might see if I can save the individual words separately. One area I got tripped up on was knowing how to retrieve a word by using it’s UUID.</p>
      <p>We were also introduced to different types of style guides including content, branding, development, human interface guidelines, and front end. We focused on front end style guides, something I didn’t even know existed. I could see using the <a href="http://www.poormansstyleguide.com/" target="blank">poor mans style guide</a> as a quick way to document smaller sites I work on.</p>
      <p>We learned a lot in the four plus weeks. Coming into the class, I didn’t have a lot of experience using GIT and command line tools. Collaborating on the pet adoption site forced me to become more comfortable with Git and Github and as a bonus I learned about gh-pages! By working through the command line tutorial and using Yeoman I have a better understanding of how command line tools can speed up development and how to use them. I appreciated the flexible nature of the class, but there were times where I was a little uncertain about what was expected for the next class. Maybe if the assignments or expectations were given over the slack channel after every class this might cut down on some confusion. In all, it was a great class and I’ll be thinking about coming back for the JavaScript immersion class if my schedule opens up enough down the road.</p>
